# Option Pricing with Dynamic Conditional Skewness

## Introduction
This repository contains the MATLAB and Stata code accompanying the paper "Option Pricing with Dynamic Conditional Skewness". The code includes implementations for calculating option prices using the Dynamic Conditional Skewness model, as well as scripts for generating various figures and tables presented in the paper.

## Contents
- `Data/`: Folder containing the datasets used in the models.
- `GARCHOptionsToolbox/`: MATLAB toolbox for GARCH option pricing models.
- `Calcu_RMSE/`: Script for calculating the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of model predictions.
- `Fig1_Dynamics_Skewness_Volatility.m`: MATLAB script for generating Figure 1, which illustrates the dynamics of skewness and volatility.
- `Fig2_Intraday_Skewness.m`: MATLAB script for generating Figure 2, showing intraday skewness.
- `Fig3_Densities.m`: MATLAB script for generating Figure 3, depicting option pricing densities.
- `Fig4_Historical_Series.m`: MATLAB script for generating Figure 4, a historical series of data.
- `Fig5_Autocorrelations.m`: MATLAB script for generating Figure 5, which analyzes autocorrelations.
- `Table1_Summary_Stats.m`: MATLAB script for generating Table 1, summarizing the statistics.
- `Table3_4_Fig6_Options_Stats.do`: Stata do-file for generating Table 3, 4 and Figure 6, related to options statistics.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (version XXX or later)
- Stata (version XXX or later)

## Usage
Each script is self-contained and can be run independently to reproduce the figures and tables in the paper. Make sure the `Data/` folder is in the MATLAB path before running the scripts.
